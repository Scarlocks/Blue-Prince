		(After Buying from Bookshop) The Curse of Black Bridge - Redford Ewling
			Borrowed by: Me (Jan 5 '94)
			"This book was graciously gifted by SIMON P. JONES (me)
			Foreword:
				legend of Grand Realm, this is his grandmothers version of the story,
			Part One: The Berry Picker From Oris:
				"The Unholy Hounds" were worst feral outlaws in a bad time, primary
				robbery = highroad robbery, one of them was a 13 year old boy (Jesper),
				lost 2 brothers (war) and parents (famine), lived in a gutter behind churchyard,
				ate bugs and weeds from the cracks of the alleyway, in these conditions he would
				do good, he eventually ended up at the bottom of Black Bridge Canyon, where he
				met the gang (Unholy Hounds), he was goodhearted boy and often teased by the gang,
				he was assigned the innocent role of berry picker, Jesper was ok with it,
				One day he set into the woods, but no bushes to be found, after a while he found
				the best patch (enormous red dots), he was happy, he was set to keep it a secret
				as the gang would appreciate his hard work, but thunders interrupted him,
				and a roadway appeared near him with it a carriage, he hid behind the larger
				bushes, elegant carriage with gold trims and two white horses, it was a royal
				carriage, The driver spotted the boy, driver: "you should be here", Jesper: "I was picking
				berries", driver saw the basket and was chill, driver: "this spot is good", driver:
				"I picked berries as a boy", boy was very happy because he yielded four times as much,
				driver: "where is you home, boy?", Jesper with a scripted response: "south of Tanner Fork",
				even though Tanner Fork was in the opposite direction (it was reasonable closer to
				Black Bridge Canyon), Jesper asked if he had tasted them, the driver answered that in
				his youth but didnt eat much as it was close to him, Jesper offered for both of them
				to enjoy, After the man touched the first berry the boy decided to rob him,
				Jesper searched for a purse and then asked where is the purse, the driver pointed towards
				the carriage door and said "theres a lockbox in the carriage...", Jesper guided him away
				from the carriage to a nearby tree to get on his kness and hands behing his back,
				the man then said if he should show mercy to the boy as the boy showed him, the boy
				answered that if there is no lockbox there will be no mercy, Inside the carriage
				was surprisingly dusty probably because there was no passenger for many years,
				A large wooden lockbox was there, Jesper carried outside, there were Totemic symbols
				carved on all four sides hinting it was very old and likely not created by Orindian hands,
				it reminded him of artifacts from the old world and crafted in one of the ancient realms,
				the box was secured by a key, the driver said that there is no lock to that box, Jesper
				grabbed a rock and tried to break the box, the box immediatly broke, there was a crude
				figure chiseled from stone inside, the driver than said that the boy was cursed now,
				"you have opened that which should never have been opened and you are cursed.",
				Jesper asked what was it while walking towards the man, the man replied "Thats One",
				driver: "One pace", driver: "twelve more and you will be dead." Jesper bashed the
				driver with the statue (killing him), Jesper worried but skeptical and didnt move,
				until he remember the two white horses and calculated Four paces to the roadway
				(maybe three if he jumped), and parted with the statue as it might be valuable.
			Part Two: Below The Black Bridge:
				Millar (woman) awoke to someone nudging her, she remembered she was on the
				third watch for the day (before sunrise), so she grabbed her things and left
				the cavern's main passage, she was careful not to wake any of the bandits around
				her "Like a hero in a book", she grabbed a bow and went to start her shift,
				around the few trees she could see Ravia ontop of a tree, Calling out to each other
				was forbidden, Anything louder than a gesture was forbidden, Miller went to the
				tree and Ravia lowered a braided rope while asking for water, Miller sent the water
				through the rope and then followed, Ravia was thirsty, Ravia splashed her face on
				the first sip, It became too daring and noisy of a joke, They had been on the third
				watch together for a month, they were friends (rare for Ungoly Hounds),
				they could see the concealed entrance of the cavern and the giant bridge that spanned
				across the canyon, Black Bridge was between gentry lands and northern mountains,
				it connected Oris and Reddington, they robbed people on the bridge at night,
				Miller liked the night but since it was morning she felt exposed,
				They heard approaching steps, she picked up her bow and two men emerged from
				the bridge's southern end, They were dressed with a familiar uniform:
				long gray coats with black facings, white waistcoats, and black tricorne hats,
				They were the local patrol (Blackguard), not an unusual sight as normally meaning
				that there was going to be an important person in the passing the bridge,
				they normally would message their leaders as soon as the coast was clear,
				the gang wouldnt take a carriage in daylight when Blackguard was nearby,
				Ravia and Miller were concerned that it didnt seem like a typical carriage,
				the sounds came from below canyon insted of the highroad, Milled drew her bow,
				since there was no road below the girls thought the base was being compromised,
				This was a Blackguard attack, the moment they saw the horses they shot,
				they expected a cavalry so they were surprised to see a carriage,
				they kept shooting and after the third arrow the carriage passed through
				a bump that tossed the driver, The entire gang was all up and active,
				Ravia looked up at Miller shocked, From gestures they knew they made a mistake,
				the gangs leader (Geoffrey Heartslasher) cautiously approached the crashed carriage,
				they saw the flung driver with a bow on his back and a statue carved from stone,
				Miller was inconsolable because Jesper was her favorite, They buried him in the
				back of one of the larger cavern rooms with him a silk handkerchief and a berry
				basket, the statue served as a distinguished gravestone, Miller woke up the next
				day to a thunder and rattling of the earth, dust and panic was around but no silence
				from the gang, the whispers were getting louder and intense, Miller walked to the mouth
				of the cave and could finally see, it wasnt daylight, Ravia pulled her and by gestures
				relayed that one critical piece of information was missing, An hour later the screams
				began, cries of hopeless desperation, Captain Fodric Lee of the Blackguard looked down
				from the canyon to see the collapsed entrance of the cave, Fodric: "Now they speak."

			"This book was graciously gifted by SIMON P. JONES (me)
			introduction: Scholars of first era tried hiding things in sigils,
				Study of Realm Sigils
			The Sigil: 4 pieces: Core, Dividing Lines (Rays), Motes, Border
			Core (Center): Tells name
				5 types: Orinda Aries (mirror), Fenn Aries (pentagon),
					Eraja (time), Corarica (Heart), Arch Aries (peaks)
					(from classroom we learn that:
						peaks flag (pf) = YEL, heart flag (hf) = ORA, time flag (tf) = PUR)
					(from Library we learn that:
						arch aries, eraja, Fenn, (Orindia/black flags burned) substituited for red flags,
						last era = Fenn Aries (Red), Arch Aries and eraja
					(from Master Bedroom we learn that a arch rainbow symbol is white, in the Mora Jai Box)
			The Rays: number of rays and mode
				Transportation (Number of rays): 
					8 = Ship/Naval (directions on a compass rose)
					4 = Roads/Streets/Carriages (crossroads)
					4 (lower only) = Horseback/trails/galloping (horse galloping)
					3 = Train/Locomotion (track)
					5 (upper only) = Aviation (above the horizon)
					2 = Camels/Mules (flat terrain)
					5 (4 + 1UR) = Turtleback (doesnt extend from the core to the border)
				Weather (style of ray): native weather
					Straight line = Normal,			Several horizontal = FOGGY,
					Wavy = HEAT,					3 Vertical lines = RAIN
					jagged = STORMY,				dotted = SNOW
					bent = WINDY
			Motes: type of society, what they consider themselves
				(not sure if its a hint or not, but the motes to set an example are out of order
					Trib, Acad, Agri, Indu, Mart, Metr, Spir, Poet)
				Tribal (hunters/gatheres *),			Agricultural (Harvest,circle with 3 dots),
				Martial (military, peaks),				Metropolitan (urban, paper),
				Academic (knoledge, 3 vertical lines),	Industrial (Manufacturing, square with dot),
				Spiritual (nature, pizza),				Poetic (arts, flower)
			Border: banner and nation colors
				black (black dots),		red (zig-zag diagonal),
				violet (-l-),			pink (gear),

			Tools of the Trade: its important to have the right tool in your inventory,
				From classic compasses and T-squares to software upgrades
			The Guiding Compass: Drafting Items
				Items that affect special floorplan costs:
					Gems = allows you to draft special floorplans
					Stopwatch = short-term bypass to all gem costs
					Emerald Bracelet = Bought, removes all gem costs
					Repellent Spray = remove the room
				Items that affect drawing and the draft pool:
					Ivory Dice = allows rerolling
					Brass Compass = if it has an exit it will be north
					Silver Key = garantees enough rooms
					Gear Wrench = adjusts the rarity of Mechanical Rooms
					Ornate Compass = bought, can rorate floorplan
			Glue, Grease and Guts: Workshop Contraptions

				If you have a keycard you can change the settings
					in security to high or low,
				Watering Can can be refilled using a faucet with running water
				Most Green Rooms can only be drafted along the edges of
					your house and the Secret Garden Key can only unlock along the
					edges
				Fancy Ruby Socketed Candlesticks are triggers that are tripped

			The Death of Drafting: A fear every architect faces.
				when you have only one way and its a dead end
				picture of Draxus (death angel), with a compass on a paper
			No Exit Strategies: Guide to Dead Ends:
				Dead end = no exits, every house needs some dead ends,
				Each dead end drafted is removed from the draft pool, the more you draw them
				the more you are likely to draw others, drafting a dead end behind (south)
				is a great strategy, try to fill every open slot before moving north
				picture of an ideal spot to draft a dead end (where adjoining rooms
				have no doors to this spot)
			Grave Mistake: An introduction to the TOMB:
				the TOMB benefit the most around dead ends, architects know immediately
				if their strategy should be around dead ends, the TOMB is designed
				by the Orindian architects, the eight (8) Ajeran angels are scattered
				through out the tomb, youll be seeing them alot when dead ends as
				you'll visit the tomb more, this strategy depends of:
					finding shops, having steps to return to the grounds and
					drafting as many dead ends as possible, great for risk reward.
				Picture of VEIA (cleaning/duster broom angel)
			Grounds For Termination: Guide to Outer Rooms:
				8 unique OUTER ROOMS, great for planning out their strategy with greater
				precision and purpose, SCHOOLHOUSE will prioritize getting gems for
				the CLASSROOM floorplans, HOVEL day will focus on extra steps
			Outer Rooms of Note:
				HOVEL = "Grounds for Termination" is a play on words but it isnt a joke to the
					groundskeeper Denny Revane (hovel is his home)
				TOOLSHED = groundskeeper's toolshed to draft useful items (shovel/sledge hammer)
				TRADING POST = frequented by local farmers and hunters who supply the estate
					with goods in exchange for a few shiny trinkets
				ROOT CELLAR = vegetables/fruits from locals are preserved here, When winter
					arrives these stored goods are traded back for a reliable source of
					sustenance
				SHELTER = Even further underground, like the root cellar its purpose is
					preservation, its people rather than food, against fallout,
					radiation, red rooms
			Enshrined Ideals: An introduction to the SHRINE:
				A mystical cavern filled with the glow of candlelight, show respect
				and pay tribute gets blessed by unseen forces that guide this world,
				BLESSINGS benefits that last several days for those who offer gold,
				type and duration can vary depending on the amount of gold given,
				more you offer, longer the blessing
			Shrine Blessings:
				Tinkerer: Mechanical Room = +1 current experiment
				Berry Picker: while drafting you can pick a berry, draft any floorplan from draft pool
				Chef: spread = +1 dish on Dining Room
				Gardener: +8 Courtyards to today's draft pool
				General: Red Room (at least 5 ranks with red) = +5 gems
				Monk: call it a day = draw the room on the grounds the following day
				Dancer: gem = spin floorplans
				High Roller: shop = +1 ivory die, use ivory die = +10 coins
			Top Five Dead Ends: As selected by the Editorial Staff of DRAFTING STRATEGY:
				1. Attic: if toolshed is good, attic is amazing, always pays for itself
				2. Study: most powerful room for architect with lots of gems
				3. Coat check: allows strategies to a specific item of choice
				4. Hovel: if steps are not necessary hovel is an unbeatable force
				5. Secret Passage: is a DEAD END, color specific strategies
			DEAD END CONTEST: Mail in sweepstakes:
				Jan 20 1989: Tarro Martize drafted 19 dead ends in one day
				"CAN YOU BEAT HIS RECORD?"
				draft 20+ Dead Ends and you could win 200 gold and the Trophy of
				sweepstakes
				(using magnifying glass):
					Eligibility: 12 years+, no Employees or roommates of DRAFTING STRATEGIES
					ENTRY: only DEAD END counts, if more than 19 = winner
					PRIZE: 200 coin value, trophy = 30 coin value, trophy is not gold but coated
						in gold, winner will recieve the prize via mail no longer than 5 days after
						the record (Check MAIL ROOM for prize delivery)
					ODDS: previous record was very good, best of luck

		Monkey should be at a very end, close to the tail (Hubris)
		then, Dog should be at the opposite (Mundanity),
		also, Bear should be on sloth as he is wasting time (Sloth)
		also, Dolphin should be at Gluttony because it has 8 letters (Gluttony)
		Since the only left with the letter "N" is Envy, it should be Lion (Envy)
		To be close to the painting it should be lust because its being the closest to
			with the available positions
		Being thin is because lust and envy has 4 letters so Elephant is in Wrath
		Since there are only three words that has a repeating letter
			Gluttony, Avarice and Mundanity, but 2 ocupied, Bunny should be at Avarice (Avarice)

		Try 1
		"Hubris"/Monkey, "Envy"/Lion, "Lust"/Swan, "Wrath"/Elephant,
