		(After Buying from Bookshop) The Curse of Black Bridge - Redford Ewling
			Borrowed by: Me (Jan 5 '94)
			"This book was graciously gifted by SIMON P. JONES (me)
			Foreword:
				legend of Grand Realm, this is his grandmothers version of the story,
			Part One: The Berry Picker From Oris:
				"The Unholy Hounds" were worst feral outlaws in a bad time, primary
				robbery = highroad robbery, one of them was a 13 year old boy (Jesper),
				lost 2 brothers (war) and parents (famine), lived in a gutter behind churchyard,
				ate bugs and weeds from the cracks of the alleyway, in these conditions he would
				do good, he eventually ended up at the bottom of Black Bridge Canyon, where he
				met the gang (Unholy Hounds), he was goodhearted boy and often teased by the gang,
				he was assigned the innocent role of berry picker, Jesper was ok with it,
				One day he set into the woods, but no bushes to be found, after a while he found
				the best patch (enormous red dots), he was happy, he was set to keep it a secret
				as the gang would appreciate his hard work, but thunders interrupted him,
				and a roadway appeared near him with it a carriage, he hid behind the larger
				bushes, elegant carriage with gold trims and two white horses, it was a royal
				carriage, The driver spotted the boy, driver: "you should be here", Jesper: "I was picking
				berries", driver saw the basket and was chill, driver: "this spot is good", driver:
				"I picked berries as a boy", boy was very happy because he yielded four times as much,
				driver: "where is you home, boy?", Jesper with a scripted response: "south of Tanner Fork",
				even though Tanner Fork was in the opposite direction (it was reasonable closer to
				Black Bridge Canyon), Jesper asked if he had tasted them, the driver answered that in
				his youth but didnt eat much as it was close to him, Jesper offered for both of them
				to enjoy, After the man touched the first berry the boy decided to rob him,
				Jesper searched for a purse and then asked where is the purse, the driver pointed towards
				the carriage door and said "theres a lockbox in the carriage...", Jesper guided him away
				from the carriage to a nearby tree to get on his kness and hands behing his back,
				the man then said if he should show mercy to the boy as the boy showed him, the boy
				answered that if there is no lockbox there will be no mercy, Inside the carriage
				was surprisingly dusty probably because there was no passenger for many years,
				A large wooden lockbox was there, Jesper carried outside, there were Totemic symbols
				carved on all four sides hinting it was very old and likely not created by Orindian hands,
				it reminded him of artifacts from the old world and crafted in one of the ancient realms,
				the box was secured by a key, the driver said that there is no lock to that box, Jesper
				grabbed a rock and tried to break the box, the box immediatly broke, there was a crude
				figure chiseled from stone inside, the driver than said that the boy was cursed now,
				"you have opened that which should never have been opened and you are cursed.",
				Jesper asked what was it while walking towards the man, the man replied "Thats One",
				driver: "One pace", driver: "twelve more and you will be dead." Jesper bashed the
				driver with the statue (killing him), Jesper worried but skeptical and didnt move,
				until he remember the two white horses and calculated Four paces to the roadway
				(maybe three if he jumped), and parted with the statue as it might be valuable.
			Part Two: Below The Black Bridge:
				Millar (woman) awoke to someone nudging her, she remembered she was on the
				third watch for the day (before sunrise), so she grabbed her things and left
				the cavern's main passage, she was careful not to wake any of the bandits around
				her "Like a hero in a book", she grabbed a bow and went to start her shift,
				around the few trees she could see Ravia ontop of a tree, Calling out to each other
				was forbidden, Anything louder than a gesture was forbidden, Miller went to the
				tree and Ravia lowered a braided rope while asking for water, Miller sent the water
				through the rope and then followed, Ravia was thirsty, Ravia splashed her face on
				the first sip, It became too daring and noisy of a joke, They had been on the third
				watch together for a month, they were friends (rare for Ungoly Hounds),
				they could see the concealed entrance of the cavern and the giant bridge that spanned
				across the canyon, Black Bridge was between gentry lands and northern mountains,
				it connected Oris and Reddington, they robbed people on the bridge at night,
				Miller liked the night but since it was morning she felt exposed,
				They heard approaching steps, she picked up her bow and two men emerged from
				the bridge's southern end, They were dressed with a familiar uniform:
				long gray coats with black facings, white waistcoats, and black tricorne hats,
				They were the local patrol (Blackguard), not an unusual sight as normally meaning
				that there was going to be an important person in the passing the bridge,
				they normally would message their leaders as soon as the coast was clear,
				the gang wouldnt take a carriage in daylight when Blackguard was nearby,
				Ravia and Miller were concerned that it didnt seem like a typical carriage,
				the sounds came from below canyon insted of the highroad, Milled drew her bow,
				since there was no road below the girls thought the base was being compromised,
				This was a Blackguard attack, the moment they saw the horses they shot,
				they expected a cavalry so they were surprised to see a carriage,
				they kept shooting and after the third arrow the carriage passed through
				a bump that tossed the driver, The entire gang was all up and active,
				Ravia looked up at Miller shocked, From gestures they knew they made a mistake,
				the gangs leader (Geoffrey Heartslasher) cautiously approached the crashed carriage,
				they saw the flung driver with a bow on his back and a statue carved from stone,
				Miller was inconsolable because Jesper was her favorite, They buried him in the
				back of one of the larger cavern rooms with him a silk handkerchief and a berry
				basket, the statue served as a distinguished gravestone, Miller woke up the next
				day to a thunder and rattling of the earth, dust and panic was around but no silence
				from the gang, the whispers were getting louder and intense, Miller walked to the mouth
				of the cave and could finally see, it wasnt daylight, Ravia pulled her and by gestures
				relayed that one critical piece of information was missing, An hour later the screams
				began, cries of hopeless desperation, Captain Fodric Lee of the Blackguard looked down
				from the canyon to see the collapsed entrance of the cave, Fodric: "Now they speak."

			Core (Center): Tells name
				5 types: Orinda Aries (mirror), Fenn Aries (pentagon),
					Eraja (time), Corarica (Heart), Arch Aries (peaks)
					(from classroom we learn that:

					(from Library we learn that:
						arch aries, eraja, Fenn, (Orindia/black flags burned) substituited for red flags,

					Nook(+1key), Breakfast Nook(+bacon & Eggs), Reading Nook(always draw library)
				there are 16 total disks
			Tool Tips: Tricks for Itemized success
				Stringing hallways with Hall Pass is the most straightforward,
					Drafting floorplans like Tunnel and Secret Passage are easy
					to set up longer chains of hallways,
				If you have a keycard you can change the settings
					in security to high or low,
				Watering Can can be refilled using a faucet with running water
				Most Green Rooms can only be drafted along the edges of
					your house and the Secret Garden Key can only unlock along the
					edges
				Fancy Ruby Socketed Candlesticks are triggers that are tripped
					when the candle is lit (mechanically)
			Word From the editor: look at each item and see their potential,
				its the same potential in yourself, it's the hands and
				brilliant mind that sculpt the grand structures

		(After Buying from Bookshop) Drafting Strategy: Architectural Digest (Vol. 5) October Issue
			Borrowed by: Me (Jan 13 '94)
			"This book was graciously gifted by SIMON P. JONES (me)
			The Death of Drafting: A fear every architect faces.
				when you have only one way and its a dead end
				picture of Draxus (death angel), with a compass on a paper
			No Exit Strategies: Guide to Dead Ends:
				Dead end = no exits, every house needs some dead ends,
				Each dead end drafted is removed from the draft pool, the more you draw them
				the more you are likely to draw others, drafting a dead end behind (south)
				is a great strategy, try to fill every open slot before moving north
				picture of an ideal spot to draft a dead end (where adjoining rooms
				have no doors to this spot)
			Grave Mistake: An introduction to the TOMB:
				the TOMB benefit the most around dead ends, architects know immediately
				if their strategy should be around dead ends, the TOMB is designed
				by the Orindian architects, the eight (8) Ajeran angels are scattered
				through out the tomb, youll be seeing them alot when dead ends as
				you'll visit the tomb more, this strategy depends of:
					finding shops, having steps to return to the grounds and
					drafting as many dead ends as possible, great for risk reward.
				Picture of VEIA (cleaning/duster broom angel)
			Grounds For Termination: Guide to Outer Rooms:
				8 unique OUTER ROOMS, great for planning out their strategy with greater
				precision and purpose, SCHOOLHOUSE will prioritize getting gems for
				the CLASSROOM floorplans, HOVEL day will focus on extra steps
			Outer Rooms of Note:
				HOVEL = "Grounds for Termination" is a play on words but it isnt a joke to the
					groundskeeper Denny Revane (hovel is his home)
				TOOLSHED = groundskeeper's toolshed to draft useful items (shovel/sledge hammer)
				TRADING POST = frequented by local farmers and hunters who supply the estate
					with goods in exchange for a few shiny trinkets
				ROOT CELLAR = vegetables/fruits from locals are preserved here, When winter
					arrives these stored goods are traded back for a reliable source of
					sustenance
				SHELTER = Even further underground, like the root cellar its purpose is
					preservation, its people rather than food, against fallout,
					radiation, red rooms
			Enshrined Ideals: An introduction to the SHRINE:
				A mystical cavern filled with the glow of candlelight, show respect
				and pay tribute gets blessed by unseen forces that guide this world,
				BLESSINGS benefits that last several days for those who offer gold,
				type and duration can vary depending on the amount of gold given,
				more you offer, longer the blessing
			Shrine Blessings:
				Tinkerer: Mechanical Room = +1 current experiment
				Berry Picker: while drafting you can pick a berry, draft any floorplan from draft pool
				Chef: spread = +1 dish on Dining Room
				Gardener: +8 Courtyards to today's draft pool
				General: Red Room (at least 5 ranks with red) = +5 gems
				Monk: call it a day = draw the room on the grounds the following day
				Dancer: gem = spin floorplans
				High Roller: shop = +1 ivory die, use ivory die = +10 coins
			Top Five Dead Ends: As selected by the Editorial Staff of DRAFTING STRATEGY:
				1. Attic: if toolshed is good, attic is amazing, always pays for itself
				2. Study: most powerful room for architect with lots of gems
				3. Coat check: allows strategies to a specific item of choice
				4. Hovel: if steps are not necessary hovel is an unbeatable force
				5. Secret Passage: is a DEAD END, color specific strategies
			DEAD END CONTEST: Mail in sweepstakes:
				Jan 20 1989: Tarro Martize drafted 19 dead ends in one day
				"CAN YOU BEAT HIS RECORD?"
				draft 20+ Dead Ends and you could win 200 gold and the Trophy of
				sweepstakes
				(using magnifying glass):
					Eligibility: 12 years+, no Employees or roommates of DRAFTING STRATEGIES
					ENTRY: only DEAD END counts, if more than 19 = winner
					PRIZE: 200 coin value, trophy = 30 coin value, trophy is not gold but coated
						in gold, winner will recieve the prize via mail no longer than 5 days after
						the record (Check MAIL ROOM for prize delivery)
					ODDS: previous record was very good, best of luck
			Word From the editor: hope you found inspiration in the realm of death and DEAD END
				rooms, remember theres beauty in unknwon and the macabre

		(After Buying from Bookshop) A New Clue by Marion Marigold - Sundial Publishing 1988
			Borrowed by: Me (Jan 13 '94)
			"This book was graciously gifted by SIMON P. JONES (me)
			(all pictures require magnifying glass)

			"All he needed was to find a new clue, If he found a new clue, he'd know what to do,
				If he knew what to do, he'd likely tell you, For you are looking for a new clue too!"
			Picture of someone (guy with a hat from rumpus ?) looking at a wall of items:
				notable "Route 8",
			
			"He had retraced his sketches and studied the files, Reviewed all his cases and gone
				through the piles Of the evidence present and precedents evident, And retraced his
				steps, as it stretched on for miles."
			Picture of the detective reading a book with lots of boxes and books around.
				"Dead Cases: Lavatory, Closet, Attic, Furnace, Solarium",
				"Corner Cases: Parlor, Patio (checked), Nook (checked), Office (checked),
					Library, Pantry (checked)"
				"Suspect List: Rose Bali (Age 50), Richard Scott (Age 12), Frond Nayford (Age 32),
					Sandra Dillion (Age 14), Bo Lee (Age 16), Charles Riscal (Age 12),
					Christoph Clarke (Age 25)
				"Depart"

			"He had looked high and low(8) in(12) all(1) of the rooms(5 14), He had searched every corner(3)
				in each of the(13) tombs, In this particular case(4 9), he had(6) checked(2) every space.
				If he found(11) a(7) new clue(10), he'd know what to do."
			Picture of a Rook tower, angel of mace, stones, the two candles from
				Chapel, Sign "Keep left"
			
			"He looked and he looked under beds and in nooks, He questioned the maids, he questioned the
				cooks, It was already over when he spoke to the chauffeur, Who told him new clues were
				found in books.
			Picture: Apple banana and orange in table (equivalent to 10 in steps),
				"To Tanner Fork" left, 

			"So tome after tome that the library loaned, And the books that he had that he already owned,
				Were searched from their covers all the way through, If he found a new clue, he'd
				know what to do."
			Picture: all 2 clocks points to 1:30 (just like room 46), woman holding a sign to the right,
				"Tender Cipher" (RED) book, "Lunar Renamed" (GREEN) book, "Uncle Awe" (PURPLE) book,
				"Draft The Sixes" (BLUE) book

			"He changed all the letters in the lines that he found, He checked all the colors of the
				spines that were bound, He doubled the meaning of each seasonal greeting, And found
				that the diction of each was sound."
			Picture: the detective writing, "Merry/Mary", "Gates/Gaits", (UR)"Right/Write",
				"Lor = word, Jor = Name", "Draft the Sixes -> Shifted Extras -> the Fixed Sta..."
				"Dead End" sign
			
			"He stayed up all night and studied the maps, He laid out the floorplans and measured the
				gaps, And if his directory was considered a trajectory, It was nothing short of a full
				mental lapse."
			Picture: the detective drawing floorplans, with a hammer and a vase at the entrance hall,
				lots of boxes on the sides, "Record" appearing in the 2nd left
			
			""A man obsessed, and cuckoo too", They would say as he would wander through. The best
				medicine is not yet evidence, If he found a new clue, he'd know what to do."
			Picture: the detective without his hat, reading the colored books in a previous picture
				"EACH" sign on north
			
			"And having read this book so many times, Having scoured over each of its cryptic lines,
				Have you exhausted your search? Have you seen all the signs?"
			Picture: photo of Clara and Simon (Ballroom), photo of Caleb Manning marigold Phillip
				White (Publisher) (Safehouse), photo of a bird flying, chess piece = white king
				"STOP" sign, "ma jor", "Seen all the signs?" with red circle and 2 overlapping

					"library" circled, "covers" point to "RED", "the way" point to "X->Y->Z->A->B->C"
					"RED page A word X, GREEN page C word A, VIOLET page B word Y, BLUE page Z word X 

			"Or is there perhaps something new, Something overlooked but now in view, Have you
				finally found it? Could it really be true? If it's a new clue, you know what to do."
			Picture: Blue note: "THE SUSPECT IS MINOR", red note: "THE SUSPECT IS MINER",
				written red note: "The suspect is major"
				"the suspect is A. Key", "On the way" sign"
		Solutions:
			(if we rearrange): all checked corner case rooms had a low case clue found in the rooms"
				meaning: Patio (checked), Nook (checked), Office (checked), Pantry (checked)"
				(if we check the low case clue): Patio = "buried",
				Nook = "beside", Office = "west", Pantry = "bridge" -> "buried beside west bridge"

			(assuming you haven't found the vase): the picture that shows a hammer and a vase at the entrance hall.
				meaning you should try to break it.

			(The pathway): "Route 8", "Depart", "Keep left", "To Tanner Fork",
				sign to the right,	"Dead End", "Record", "EACH", "STOP", "On the way".
				This is the same as the security room footage of Mary:
					8 -> 7 -> 3 -> 10 -> 1 -> 13 or 8, 7, 3, 10, 1, 13
					Royal Station -> Angel Tower -> Aries Crossing -> Tanner Fork -> Oris Train Hall -> Dead End
			(if Draft The Sixes is The Fixed Stars, then the books are:):
				"Tender Cipher" (RED) = "The Red Prince", "Lunar Renamed" (GREEN) = "Realm and Rune"
				"Uncle Awe" (PURPLE) = "A New Clue", "Draft The Sixes" (BLUE) = "The Fixed Stars"
			(for the X, Y, Z, A, B, C):
				if we assume that the path way was 8, 7, 3, 10, 1, 13, we can try:
				(Assuming the page count starts on title pages)
				RED (The Red Prince) page A(10) word X(8),
				GREEN (Realm and Rune) page C(13) word A(10),
				VIOLET (A New Clue) page B(1) word Y(7),
				BLUE (The Fixed Stars) page Z(3) word X(8)
				Answer: "Turn scorched sundial base."

			(For the suspect puzzle): 
				Blue note: "THE SUSPECT IS MINOR" meaning it's age is less than 18,
				red note: "THE SUSPECT IS MINER" means nothing,
				written red note: "The suspect is major" means the suspect has a "small name" (major)
				"the suspect is A. Key" might be Admin Key (Grotto)
				
				The Suspect is not: Rose Bali (Age 50), Frond Nayford (Age 32), Christoph Clarke (Age 25)
				Suspect List: 
					Richard Scott (Age 12) = ScoR
					Sandra Dillion (Age 14) = DilS
					Bo Lee (Age 16) (small name) = LeeB (Answer)
					Charles Riscal (Age 12) = RisC

	Piano Room
	Photo: Clara and Simon Inneclipse Ball 1952
	Music Sheets:
	6) Under these stars, the dance is held
		And to the floor we ARE compelled,
		The gowns glide on and music sweels
		And at the end the clock strikes twelve,
		What that means only time can tell
	7) Two remain for one last dance,
		And spin again around clock hands,
		And as they turn, a second chance
		To rise above the falling sands
		The TRUE time lost in past romance.

	2) Among this scattered symphony
		A message hidden beneath the keys,
		In bold WORDS sung by you and me
		A fractured note an urgent plea,
		In bold words sung I do repeat
	3) The ones of you who oft assume
		That you alone can solve this tune,
		Are likely going to get your due
		And all rage that will ensue,
		While working ON this simple clue
	4) White pages lined with melodies
		Do hide the words we've come to seek
		And from our choice among all these,
		We write down one that seems to be
		THE loudest type with ink that bleeds

		Dolphin = number of letters is 8,	Lion = has "N",

		Elephant = neighbor is thin (number of letters),
		Bunny = i have the same letter as my neighbor that has 2,
		Bear = a min or ten in the den,		Monkey = near the tail of the skin on the floor


		Monkey should be at a very end, close to the tail (Hubris)
		then, Dog should be at the opposite (Mundanity),
		also, Bear should be on sloth as he is wasting time (Sloth)
		also, Dolphin should be at Gluttony because it has 8 letters (Gluttony)
		Since the only left with the letter "N" is Envy, it should be Lion (Envy)
		To be close to the painting it should be lust because its being the closest to
			with the available positions
		Being thin is because lust and envy has 4 letters so Elephant is in Wrath
		Since there are only three words that has a repeating letter
			Gluttony, Avarice and Mundanity, but 2 ocupied, Bunny should be at Avarice (Avarice)

		Try 1
		"Hubris"/Monkey, "Envy"/Lion, "Lust"/Swan, "Wrath"/Elephant,
		"Gluttony"/Dolphin, "Sloth"/Bear, "Avarice"/Bunny, "Mundanity"/Dog

		01-17-79	"My dear diary,
			After countless sleepless nights and failed home remedies, my physician has urged
			me to document my sleeping routines in the various bedrooms of our estate.
			It is his hope that by tracking the caliber and length of my sleep in each room,
			together, we may come to a deeper understanding of my condition and pergaps,
			with luck, find a more favorable environment in which i might finally find
			some amount of rest.
			Clara"

		01-18-79	"My dear diary,
			To begin, I thought it best to start with my own room despite already knowing how
			unstuitable it has been for my sleep of late. Perhaps, it is all the old memories
			that linger here, as it is impossible not to think of home among so many mementos
			of my youth. Nonetheless, I find comfort in gazing at the stars before dozing off,
			and it pains me to consider that if this trial is successful, it may be one of the
			final occasions that i sleep here.
			Clara"

		Her Ladyship's Chamber Violetprint "MY ROOM"
			Sleep Duration - 2 and a half hours
			Quality - Peaceful despite brevity
			Observable Effects - I awoke the following morning with 10 less (steps) steps but also observed
				an additional star in the sky.
		
		01-21-79	"Dearest diary,
			Last night, I retired to the guest room as I have yet to gain the courage to ask
			anyone to surrender their room to me, even for a night. This bedroom is a cozy space,
			normally reserved for guests staying the weekend, however, I found, despite having a
			choice between two beds, that neither proved to be very comfortable. I must speak with
			Herbert about this, as our guests deserve, at the very least, as much comfort in their

		01-22-79	"My dear diary,
			It was strange to sleep in the childhood room of my late husband. The room was just as i
			had imagined it from the stories he told me of growing up with an elder brother. Herbert
			informed me that the room has remained untouched, almost identical to when they both
			occupied it - To avoid any accidents, I slept in the bottom bunk as climbing ladders is
			not as easy as it used to be. Despite my exhaustion, my thoughts of Simon kept me up
			through most of the night.

		Bunk Room Violetprint "Bunk Room"
			Sleep Duration - Twice the usual
			Quality - Two times as restless
			Observable Effects - The next morning, I went to the family tomb to visit his grave,
				and was surprised to find a flower already laid.

		01-24-79
			"I could not bring myself to ask Hartley directly if I could borrow his room for my sleep
			study, the mere thought of it was mortifying. Instead, I decided to "Roll the die," as he
			often puts it and wait for his night off to sneak into his room to nap. The experience of
			sleeping in a servant's room was thrilling, but the fear of getting caught was overwhelming.
			Every little noise startled me, and I couldn't manage to sleep for more than a few moments,
			fearing Hartley would return at any time.
			Clara"
		
		Servant's Quarters Violetprint "Servant's Quarters"
			Sleep Duration - perhaps one hour
			Quality - terrible
			Effects - About half the (steps) the following day.
				I also discovered a stray die had found it's way into my pocket. Which was hardly
				shocking, given Hartley's history.

		01-25-79	"My dear diary,
			I have to confess that I was initially hesitant to spend the night in the Baron's room. It's
			extravagantly showy, with every surface adorned with gold and every piece of furnature so large
			it seems almost comical. But as I lay down on the enormous bed, I was surprised to find that
			I felt entirely at ease. Even the absurdly oversized pillows were somehow comfortable, propping
			me up just right so that I didn't feel any strain on my neck or back. I slept more soundly than
			I have in weeks, and I woke up feeling genuinely rested for the first time in what feels like forever.
			Clara"

		01-28-79	"Dearest diary,
			As fate would have it, just as I had begun to make progress in my guest of slumber, a
			most joyous event has interrupted my progress. My beloved daughter has given birth to
			a son, and requested my presence in town to assist her during this exciting but demanding
			time.
			For now, I shall take my leave of the bedrooms of Mount Holly. But I am certain, dear diary
			that one day I shall return.

"IF WE COUNT SMALL GATES EIGHT DATES CRACK EIGHT SAFES"
So there are 8 letters which are found in safes.
If Orchard counts as a safe, then there are 8 safes
Rumpus actually tells us that one of the letters we will not read
(the orchard one)
so still meaning all of them are solvable by a date
